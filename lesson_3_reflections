When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For safekeeping / backup etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some changes might not be ready yet for public usage. So you can choose when to make the information available.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks = clone made by GitHub on their servers. Use on GitHub only.
Clones = make a copy of a repository either between local or from GitHub to local.
Branches = make a copy of a commit locally. To test or add new features to current commit or file.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So that you have the most up to date file to work with, any errors fixed etc.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Use social media or contact the person directly to discuss any changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
