When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
For safekeeping / backup etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some changes might not be ready yet for public usage. So you can choose when to make the information available.
